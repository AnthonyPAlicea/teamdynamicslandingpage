  <p>The Missing Developer Education</p>
  <p class="credit">by Tony Alicea</p>

<section class="container">
  <p>Whether you've learned software development at a school, bootcamp, online, or are entirely self-taught, there is one key aspect to being a developer that you were likely never trained on: how to deal with people on a team.</p>
  <p>Developers are also team members and, eventually, may become managers. Yet, team dynamics and soft skills are never taught to coders.</p>
  <p>This course aims to fix that.</p>
</section>

<section class="container">
  <h2>How Will This Course Help Me?</h2>
  <p>
    As a coder, designer, and manager for 25 years, I can say that cohesive teams make the best software, and coders who are good communicators and positively contribute to team cohesiveness are rare and <em>extremely</em> valuable.
  </p>
  <p>This course will help you make those positive contributions. Along the way you will enjoy your job more, build better software, and maybe even show yourself to be someone who can manage others (if that's what you want to do).</p>
  <p>
    My goal is to help you to better understand the developers, designers, and managers you work with every day. I provide you a framework to help interact with your team members in the way that maximizes your chances of getting a positive outcome from that interaction.
  </p>
  <p>We accomplish that goal by examining two key topics:</p>
  <h3>Team Dynamics</h3>
  <div class="imagegrid">
  <img src="/assets/face6.png" style="max-height: 100px;" alt="A phone with a GPS app open" />
  <p>A team is a collection of people, and team dynamics is how those people interact with one another.<br /><br />Sometimes coders like to talk as if they're purely analytical, logical beings, not emotional. But that's false. Coders are people.</p>
  </div>
  <p>That's the trap. When you just follow along with someone else coding a project, you may feel like you're learning, but when you start real-world work and you're asked to do things that aren't exactly like the projects you've done, or you face a problem that needs to be debugged...you realize that you haven't learned that much after all.</p>
  <p>So...what's the answer?</p> 
  <h3>Soft Skills</h3>
  <div class="imagegrid">
  <img class="map" src="/assets/face10.png" style="max-height: 100px;" alt="A map of a city" />
  <p>Thinking about our GPS example, this course is more like a complete map, along with the history of <em>why</em> the city is laid out the way it is.<br /><br />In this course we go, step-by-step, through <em>why</em> React is built the way it is, and we <strong>go through its source code</strong> to see how it's built and what it does.</p>
  </div>
  <p>That's right: React is just other people's JavaScript code. By understanding what is happening under-the-hood, you'll dramatically improve your ability to write and debug apps using React. You'll gain a proper mental model.</p>

  <h2>Communication Skills Are A Game Changer</h2>
  <div class="imagegrid">
  <img class="map" src="/assets/face7.png" style="max-height: 100px;" alt="A cartoon brain with a lightbulb and exclamation marks above it. It understands." />
  <p>A common barrier to learning tech is vocabulary. In this course I don't make assumptions about the words that you're familiar with.<br /><br />For example, when we look deep into React's code we see a lot of usage of linked lists. So, in this course, we will first take a moment to understand what a linked list data structure is, and why it's useful in React's case.</p>
  </div>
  <p>In fact, we'll pause briefly, but often, to make sure everything we're talking about in the course is fully understood. You'll be building a vocabulary that you'll be able to use at work, when watching or reading other content, and in your career going forward.</p>
  <p>Sometimes we mistake vocabulary for intelligence. But if there's a term or idea that's new to you while learning tech, that doesn't say anything about how smart you are. You just need to learn the vocabulary. You'll learn it in this course.</p>
