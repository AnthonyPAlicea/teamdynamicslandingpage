  <p>React is a skill that can get you a job. But most courses out there aren't teaching it to you properly.</p>
  <p>Following along and mimicking someone typing code won't help you when faced with new problems and challenges in real world jobs.</p>
  <p>This course is different.</p>
</section>

<section class="container">
  <h2>What This Course Isn't</h2>
  <p>
    This course is not a "follow along with me while we build projects" course. Yes, we build a fun project in the course (we recreate the popular online word game "Spelling Bee"!).
  </p>
  <p>
    Building projects is an important part of learning. However those "build projects with me" courses are a trap.
  </p>
  <h3>The GPS Trap</h3>
  <div class="imagegrid">
  <img src="/assets/gps.png" alt="A phone with a GPS app open" />
  <p>Following along with someone else coding, without understanding what's really happening under-the-hood, is kind of like following a GPS to your destination.<br /><br />When you get there, you may feel good. But you haven't really learned the streets or the area. If you run across a problem, like construction or a detour, and you don't have your GPS working, you quickly realize that you haven't really learned anything following the GPS.</p>
  </div>
  <p>That's the trap. When you just follow along with someone else coding a project, you may feel like you're learning, but when you start real-world work and you're asked to do things that aren't exactly like the projects you've done, or you face a problem that needs to be debugged...you realize that you haven't learned that much after all.</p>
  <p>So...what's the answer?</p> 
  <h2>What This Course Is</h2>
  <div class="imagegrid imagegrid--large">
  <img class="map" src="/assets/map.png" alt="A map of a city" />
  <p>Thinking about our GPS example, this course is more like a complete map, along with the history of <em>why</em> the city is laid out the way it is.<br /><br />In this course we go, step-by-step, through <em>why</em> React is built the way it is, and we <strong>go through its source code</strong> to see how it's built and what it does.</p>
  </div>
  <p>That's right: React is just other people's JavaScript code. By understanding what is happening under-the-hood, you'll dramatically improve your ability to write and debug apps using React. You'll gain a proper mental model.</p>
  <h3>A Proper Mental Model</h3>
  <p>A "mental model" is basically how you think something works. The more accurate your mental model, the better you can use that thing and the better you can fix problems when they arise.</p>
  <p>I read every line of React's source code so that I can impart you to an <strong>accurate mental model</strong>, meaning that you <strong>actually know how React works</strong>.</p>
  <p>An accurate mental model is the most valuable thing a coder can have when using a tool like React. You'll be faster at writing apps and better at debugging them (both your own code and others').</p>

  <h2>Vocabulary Is Not Intelligence</h2>
  <div class="imagegrid">
  <img class="map" src="/assets/brainbulb.png" style="max-height: 200px;" alt="A cartoon brain with a lightbulb and exclamation marks above it. It understands." />
  <p>A common barrier to learning tech is vocabulary. In this course I don't make assumptions about the words that you're familiar with.<br /><br />For example, when we look deep into React's code we see a lot of usage of linked lists. So, in this course, we will first take a moment to understand what a linked list data structure is, and why it's useful in React's case.</p>
  </div>
  <p>In fact, we'll pause briefly, but often, to make sure everything we're talking about in the course is fully understood. You'll be building a vocabulary that you'll be able to use at work, when watching or reading other content, and in your career going forward.</p>
  <p>Sometimes we mistake vocabulary for intelligence. But if there's a term or idea that's new to you while learning tech, that doesn't say anything about how smart you are. You just need to learn the vocabulary. You'll learn it in this course.</p>
</section>

<section class="container">
  <h2>Understand React Internals</h2>
  <p>We won't just look at code. I've put together literally hundreds of animations so that you can visualize what the React is doing internally and fully understand it.</p>
  <div><video loop autoplay muted playsinline aria-labelledby="video-label" src="/assets/ReactCompiler_Hooks.mp4"></video></div>
  <p>Then, we put that newfound mental model to use as we build your React knowledge piece-by-piece, and work through code examples together.</p>

    <article><p>I highly recommend this course! Even for devs who have worked in React for years. Tony’s way of digging through the source code under the hood has completely changed my mental model. Incredibly valuable.</p> <p>- Heather M.</p></article>
    <article><p>This is the best React course I have taken and I have taken a few to be honest. You have overdelivered on this Tony.</p> <p>- Eyitayo O.</p></article>
    <article><p>Thank you Tony, for spending the time to approach React from a deeper perspective.</p> <p>- Nicolas G.</p></article>
    <article><p>I have clear picture now how React is working under the hood. And also the last project was fun.</p> <p>- Matija R.</p></article>
    <article><p>As a self-taught developer who transitioned from education to tech, his teaching style resonates with my teacher training – exploring the “why” instead of just the “how”, gradual build up of concepts, simple explanation of technical jargons, etc. The feeling of true understanding is a deep satisfaction that hacky tricks will not achieve.</p> <p>- Shelly C.</p></article>
